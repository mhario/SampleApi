| Method | url      | Notes
|:-------|:---------|:--
| GET    | /        | Query string defaults: ?page_size=10&offset=0
| GET    | /{id}    |
| POST   | /add     | Required fields: agent_id, isActive, name, email, registered

## Assumptions
- Customers should have paginationÂ and default limit of 10 records.
- Creating a new agent should (?) require all the fields.
- Creating a new customer may need empty fields, based on available information.

## Questions
- Who should be authorized to edit these records? Should there be restrictions on viewing customers?
- Record creation / required fields ?
- Should "Delete customer" actually be interpreted as "set to inactive?"
- What sort of filters would we like on our Customers (or agents) GET requests?
